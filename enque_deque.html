    <h1>enqueue and dequeue in javascript</h1>
    <h3> A queue is defined as a linear data structure that is open at both ends and the operations are performed in
        First In First Out (FIFO) order.</h3>
    <h1>Defference between stack and queue</h1>
    <p>Ans: queue follow by FIFO order(First in first out) but stack follow by FILO order (first in last out)</p>
